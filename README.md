Kinect1473
==========

Kinect1473 experimental dev - for trying to get full compatibility with 1414 Api. This is a messy repo! 

This is based off of the ofxKinect release for OF 0.8.0.
Clone into the apps folder of an OF 0.8.0 release ( for OS X ) 

Currently it is able to upload firmware and control tilt and led. 
This is based on code written by Drew Fisher for K4W Audio support and tilt/motor support for linux. 

The ultimate goal is to detect both K4W and 1473 - flash appropriate firmware and allow motor and led control for both devices.
As well as fix the OS X disconnect issue with newer 1473 devices.
